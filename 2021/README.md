# AOC2021

> **Warning** THESE SOLUTIONS WERE WRITTEN WITH AN OLD VERSION OF CSPYDR AND ARE NO LONGER COMPATIBLE WITH CURRENT VERSIONS OF THE LANGUAGE!

My Advent of Code solutions for 2021

These solutions are written in my own programming language [CSpydr](https://github.com/spydr06/cspydr.git), which I'm developing since almost a year.
<br/>
Therefore, these solutions are far from perfect. They are here to prove the point, that CSpydr is capable of doing all important things a programming language has to do.

### Execution
For execution, you need a working installation of the [CSpydr Programming Language](https://github.com/spydr06/cspydr.git), installation instructions for which can be found on it's repository. Once installed, you can run each solution with the following shell command:

```
cspc run part1.csp
```
