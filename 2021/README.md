My Advent of Code solutions for 2021

These solutions are written in my own programming language [CSpydr](https://github.com/spydr06/cspydr.git), which I'm developing since almost a year.
<br/>
Therefore, these solutions are far from perfect. They are here to prove the point, that CSpydr is capable of doing all important things a programming language has to do.

### Execution
For execution, you need a working installation of the [CSpydr Programming Language](https://github.com/spydr06/cspydr.git), installation instructions for which can be found on it's repository. Once installed, you can run each solution with the following shell command:

```
cspc run part1.csp
```
